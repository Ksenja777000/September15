                            <p>The cat was frightened not just of the car but of Rutter. He tried to rescue the small tabby kitten but the kitten kept struggling and trying to flee. The cat ended up running from Rutter’s engine into the engine of a neighboring vehicle. Rutter despaired of rescuing the kitten himself and called the RSPCA. Two workers from the RSPCA arrived on the site and managed to get the cat out of the engine. The kitten had some infections and he was treated at an animal shelter. The cat had no owner but was adopted by a family not long after being rescued.</p>

                            <p>On his way the raccoon met a monkey. “Where are you going?” the monkey asked. “I’m going to the lake to pick berries for dinner," replied the raccoon.</p>

                            <p>“Happy birthday, my dear child!," mummy raccoon said to her young son. “You are such a big boy now!” “Does that mean that I can go to the lake on my own to gather berries for dinner?” asked the little raccoon. “Sure, of course you can,” mother raccoon replied, and so the little raccoon set off to the lake.“Are you not afraid of Him, the one who lives in the lake?!” the monkey asked. “No, not at all," replied the little raccoon, beginning to get nervous. "Is He very scary?” “Oh, yes! He is very, very scary! Here, take this stick and poke him really well to frighten him.”He then stepped on a branch which was half in the water, and looked down. The monkey was right - there was someone in the water. And he was watching him! The young raccoon frowned and raised his hand with the stick in it.</p>

                    <p>Raccoons are omnivores, which means they eat a little bit of everything. Their diet will vary a bit from season to season.</p>
